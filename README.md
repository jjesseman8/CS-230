**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**  
  The client was The Gaming Room and would like to add multiple team game play with each playing having a unique online ID. Each team can have multiple players assigned at any given time. With that being said, only one instance of the game can exist in the memory at any given time. We can accommodate this by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player. The client would also like to expand to other operating platforms.   
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**  
  I believe that my recommendations section in this document are my best work. As they clearly line out my recommendations for their software with rational as to why I chose what I did in each instance.  
**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**  
  The design document clarified the requirements as I was developing the code which in turn allowed for a clearer path. It also provides structure to the code along with reducing errors along the way. Finally it helps to facilitate collaboration between teams and saves time by making the coding more efficent.     
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
  If I could choose one part to revise it would be the UML Diagram so that I could implement security factors into it. As we know in the world we currently live in online secuirty is of the utmost importance
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**  
As you can see if you review my Client Presentaion template .pptx I took all of the user's needs and implemented them though various as well as thoughrogh ways. When designing a system, it's important to consider the user's needs to ensure that the system is effective, efficient, and user-friendly. This is especially important because users are the ones who will ultimately be using the system, and if their needs are not met, they may not use the system at all or may use it less effectively. To design a system that meets user needs, it's essential to involve users in the design process, whether through surveys, user testing, or other forms of feedback. This helps designers understand the users' goals, tasks, and pain points, which can then be used to inform the system design. By considering user needs and feedback, designers can create a system that is easy to use, intuitive, and efficient, which can lead to greater user adoption and satisfaction.  
**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**  
When analyzing and designing a system, there are several techniques and strategies that can be used. One common approach is to use a modeling language or methodology, such as UML (Unified Modeling Language), to help visualize and communicate the system's design. Other techniques that can be used include prototyping, which involves creating a working model of the system to test its functionality and gather feedback, and agile development, which involves an iterative approach to development with frequent feedback and adjustments. Ultimately, the key to successful software design is to remain focused on the problem being solved and to continually gather feedback and adjust the design to meet the needs of stakeholders and users.
